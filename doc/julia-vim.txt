==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                    *julia-vim-introduction*

The julia-vim plug-in provides:
  - basic support for editing Julia files (automatic filetype detection,
    indentation, syntax highlighting)
  - support for the matchit plugin (https://github.com/edsono/matchit)
  - facilities for conversion of LaTeX entries to Unicode symbols which mimic
    and extend what the Julia REPL and the IJulia notebook interface do

This help file documents the latter feature, how it works and what variables
can be used to enable/disable/tweak it.

==============================================================================
LATEX TO UNICODE                                *julia-vim-L2U*

In the Julia REPL, entering a LaTeX sequence such as `\alpha` and pressing the
<Tab> key substitutes it with a Unicode character such as `α`. The julia REPL
also provides partial completions, and suggestions for possible completions
upon repeated pressing of the <Tab> key.

This Vim plug-in provides the same functionality, with some extensions:
  - when a partial sequence is found, suggestions are presented in a menu
    together with their Unicode counterpart; the exact behaviour of this
    feature can be customized, see |julia-vim-L2U-tab|
  - optionally, symbols are substituted on the fly as you type them, see
    |julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type|

The substitution is triggered by the <S-Tab> combination while in command line
mode, e.g. when searching in a file with the |/| or |?| commands.

These features only work as described with Vim version 7.4 or higher. Tab
completion can still be made available on lower Vim versions, see
|julia-vim-L2U-workaround|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEX TO UNICODE VIA TAB KEY                    *julia-vim-L2U-tab*

Substitution of LaTeX sequences when pressing the <Tab> key in insert mode, or
the <S-Tab> combination while on the command line, is active by default. Use
|g:julia_latex_to_unicode| to control it.

When this feature is active, the julia-vim plug-in creates a mapping for the
<Tab> key (in |Insert| mode) which takes precedence on any previously defined
mapping assigned to it, such that when the <Tab> key is pressed the plug-in
looks for potential LaTeX symbol matches before the cursor, and if it fails to
find anything of interest it will fall-back to the previous mapping for <Tab>
(with default Vim settings, this means it will insert a literal <Tab>; but if
you have defined dome other behaviour for that key, e.g. by installing another
plug-in such as supertab (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) than that will
be used).

For example, entering this text in a file:
>
    1 + \alpha
<
and then pressing <Tab>, results in:
>
    1 + α
<

This feature is associated with 'omnifunc' completion, and therefore can
always be accessed via CTRL-X CTRL-O, even when |g:julia_latex_to_unicode| is
0.

A literal <Tab> key can always be entered by using CTRL-V before <Tab> (see
|i_CTRL-V|).

Partial sequence recognition triggers auto-completion (performed as if the
`longest` setting was used in 'completeopt') and shows a menu of suggestions
together with their corresponding Unicode symbol (provided the `menu` setting
is included in 'completeopt', and more then one match is found). So for
example, entering `\al` and pressing <Tab> will result in the following list:
>
    +-------------+
    | \aleph    ℵ |
    | \allequal ≌ |
    | \alpha    α |
    +-------------+
>
Then, pressing `p` will reduce the list to `\alpha`, pressing <Tab> will
complete it and pressing <Tab> again will perform the substitution.

The completion menu can be disbled, and this will happen automatically if a
plug-in which is known to be incompatible with this feature is detected: see
|g:julia_latex_suggestions_enabled|.

Some LaTeX sequences can be valid both as they are and as partial matches for
other sequences, e.g. `\ne` is associated with `≠`, but it is also a partial
match for `\nequiv` (`≢`). By default, if <Tab> finds an exact match performs
the substitution, but this can be controlled by the
|g:julia_latex_to_unicode_eager| setting.

Vim versions lower than 7.4                     *julia-vim-L2U-workaround*

The <Tab> key remapping is not performed by default with Vim versions lower
than 7.4. However, the functionality is still available via onmicompletion,
which is accessible by the CTRL-X CTRL-O key combination. You can map some
other key combination to this by adding something like
>
  inoremap <C-Tab> <C-X><C-O>
<
in your |.vimrc| file. If you'd map <Tab> directly, then you'd need to use
CTRL-V <Tab> to insert a literal <Tab>.

The settings |g:julia_latex_to_unicode_eager| and
|g:julia_latex_suggestions_enabled| are still meaningful in this case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEX TO UNICODE AS YOU TYPE                    *julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type*

This feature is disabled by default, see |g:julia_auto_latex_to_unicode|, and
it is only available with Vim version 7.4 or higher. It consists in
substituting valid LaTeX sequences with Unicode symbols automatically as the
typing progresses, as soon as the sequences is unambiguously complete. For
example, when typing:
>
    \chi\^2 = 1
<
The result is
>
    χ² = 1
<
The `\chi` is substituted right when the second backslash is entered, and the
`\^2` is substituted when the following space is entered, before the equal
sign.

This feature does not interfere with the <Tab> based substitution.

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                       *julia-vim-variables*

                                                *g:julia_latex_to_unicode*
g:julia_latex_to_unicode

                Determines whether to map LaTeX-to-Unicode substitution to the
                <Tab> key while in insert mode (and to the <S-Tab> combination
                for command line mode), see |julia-vim-L2U-tab|. If
                unspecified, it is on.  You can disable the feature by
                default by inserting the line
>
                    let g:julia_latex_to_unicode = 0
<
                in your |.vimrc| file. You can change this setting at any
                moment while editing, but you need to invoke
                |JuliaLaTeXtoUnicodeInit()| for the change to take effect.
                
                                         *g:julia_latex_suggestions_enabled*
g:julia_latex_suggestions_enabled

                Determines whether the <Tab> key mapping produces suggestions
                for partial matches. By default, this is set to 1 (active),
                unless a plug-in which is known to be incompatible with it is
                detected. Currently, known incompatible plug-ins are
                YouCompleteMe (https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) and
                neocomplcache (https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim).

                This variable can be set at any time, changes will immediately
                take effect.
                
                                            *g:julia_latex_to_unicode_eager*
g:julia_latex_to_unicode_eager

                Determines whether the <Tab> key mapping performs the
                substitution immediately upon finding an exact match. By
                default this setting is set to 1 (active), so that e.g. typing
                `\ne` and pressing the <Tab> key triggers the substitution. If
                this variable is set to 0, an exact match which is also a
                possible partial match to some other sequence triggers the
                suggestions menu first, but another <Tab> forces the
                substitution, so that e.g. typing `\ne` and then <Tab> produces
                a list with `\ne`, `\neg`, `\nequiv` etc., and pressing <Tab>
                again performs the substitution.

                This variable can be set at any time, changes will immediately
                take effect. When |g:julia_latex_suggestions_enabled| is 0,
                this setting has no effect (it's like if it was always on).
                
                                               *g:julia_auto_latex_to_unicode*
g:julia_auto_latex_to_unicode

                Determines whether to activate LaTeX-to-Unicode substitution
                on the fly as you type (in |Insert| mode), see
                |julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type|. If unspecified, it is 0 (off). You
                can enable the feature by default by inserting the line
>
                    let g:julia_auto_latex_to_unicode = 1
<
                in your |.vimrc| file. You can change this setting at any
                moment while editing, but you need to invoke
                |JuliaLaTeXtoUnicodeInit()| for the change to take effect.
