==============================================================================
LATEX TO UNICODE                              *julia-vim-L2U-introduction*

In the Julia REPL, entering a LaTeX sequence such as `\alpha` and pressing the
<Tab> key substitutes it with a Unicode character such as `α`. The Julia REPL
also provides partial completions, and suggestions for possible completions
upon repeated pressing of the <Tab> key.

This Vim plug-in provides the same functionality, with some extensions:
  - when a partial sequence is found, suggestions are presented in a menu
    together with their Unicode counterpart; the exact behaviour of this
    feature can be customized, see |julia-vim-L2U-tab|
  - optionally, symbols are substituted on the fly as you type them, see
    |julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type|

The substitution is triggered by the <S-Tab> combination while in command line
mode, e.g. when searching in a file with the |/| or |?| commands.

By default, this feature is only active when editing Julia files. However, it
can be also enabled with other file types, see |julia-vim-L2U-file-types|, and
even turned on/off on the fly regardless of the file type, see
|julia-vim-L2U-enable-disable|.

These features only work as described with Vim version 7.4 or higher. Tab
completion can still be made available on lower Vim versions, see
|julia-vim-L2U-workaround|.

See |julia-vim-L2U-reference| for the complete table of the available
LaTeX-to-Unicode substitutions.

See |julia-vim| for the general reference about the other features of the
julia-vim plug-in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEX TO UNICODE VIA TAB KEY                            *julia-vim-L2U-tab*

Substitution of LaTeX sequences when pressing the <Tab> key in insert mode, or
the <S-Tab> combination while on the command line, is active by default. Use
|g:latex_to_unicode_tab| to control it.

When this feature is active, the julia-vim plug-in creates a mapping for the
<Tab> key (in |Insert| mode) which takes precedence on any previously defined
mapping assigned to it, such that when the <Tab> key is pressed the plug-in
looks for potential LaTeX symbol matches before the cursor, and if it fails to
find anything of interest it will fall-back to the previous mapping for <Tab>
(with default Vim settings, this means it will insert a literal <Tab>; but if
you have defined dome other behaviour for that key, e.g. by installing another
plug-in such as supertab (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) than that will
be used).

For example, entering this text in a file:
>
    1 + \alpha
<
and then pressing <Tab>, results in:
>
    1 + α
<

This feature is associated with 'omnifunc' completion, and therefore can
always be accessed via CTRL-X CTRL-O, even when |g:latex_to_unicode_tab| is 0.

A literal <Tab> key can always be entered by using CTRL-V before <Tab> (see
|i_CTRL-V|).

Partial sequence recognition triggers auto-completion (performed as if the
`longest` setting was used in 'completeopt') and shows a menu of suggestions
together with their corresponding Unicode symbol (provided the `menu` setting
is included in 'completeopt', and more then one match is found). So for
example, entering `\al` and pressing <Tab> will result in the following list:
>
    +-------------+
    | \aleph    ℵ |
    | \allequal ≌ |
    | \alpha    α |
    +-------------+
>
Then, pressing `p` will reduce the list to `\alpha`, pressing <Tab> will
complete it and pressing <Tab> again will perform the substitution.

The completion menu can be disbled, and this will happen automatically if a
plug-in which is known to be incompatible with this feature is detected: see
|g:latex_to_unicode_suggestions|.

Some LaTeX sequences can be valid both as they are and as partial matches for
other sequences, e.g. `\ne` is associated with `≠`, but it is also a partial
match for `\nequiv` (`≢`). By default, if <Tab> finds an exact match performs
the substitution, but this can be controlled by the |g:latex_to_unicode_eager|
setting.

Vim versions lower than 7.4                     *julia-vim-L2U-workaround*

The <Tab> key remapping is not performed by default with Vim versions lower
than 7.4. However, the functionality is still available via onmicompletion,
which is accessible by the CTRL-X CTRL-O key combination. You can map some
other key combination to this by adding something like
>
  inoremap <C-Tab> <C-X><C-O>
<
in your |.vimrc| file. If you'd map <Tab> directly, then you'd need to use
CTRL-V <Tab> to insert a literal <Tab>.

The settings |g:latex_to_unicode_eager| and |g:latex_to_unicode_suggestions|
are still meaningful in this case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEX TO UNICODE AS YOU TYPE                    *julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type*

This feature is disabled by default, see |g:latex_to_unicode_auto|, and it is
only available with Vim version 7.4 or higher. It consists in substituting
valid LaTeX sequences with Unicode symbols automatically as the typing
progresses, as soon as the sequences is unambiguously complete. For example,
when typing:
>
    \chi\^2 = 1
<
The result is
>
    χ² = 1
<
The `\chi` is substituted right when the second backslash is entered, and the
`\^2` is substituted when the following space is entered, before the equal
sign.

This feature does not interfere with the <Tab> based substitution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEX TO UNICODE ON DIFFERENT FILE TYPES         *julia-vim-L2U-file-types*

By default, the LaTeX-to-Unicode substitutions are only active when editing
Julia files. However, you can use the variable |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types|
to specify for which file types this feature is active by default. The
variable must be set to a string containing a |pattern| (a regular expression)
which matches the desired file types, or to a list of such patterns. For
example, to activate the feature on all file types by default, you could put
this in your |.vimrc| file:
>
    let g:latex_to_unicode_file_types = ".*"
<
To make it active only on, say, Julia and Lisp files, you could use:
>
    let g:latex_to_unicode_file_types = ["julia", "lisp"]
<

Another option, |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist|, can be used to
exclude certain file types. For example, if you'd wish to enable the feature
in all cases except for Python and untyped files, you would use:
>
    let g:latex_to_unicode_file_types = ".*"
    let g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist = ["python", ""]
<

NOTE: enabling the functionality will override the |'omnifunc'| setting, which
can be undesirable, and interfere with plug-ins for different file types. In
any case, the previous |'omnifunc'| setting is restored when the functionality
is disabled, see |julia-vim-L2U-enable-disable|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENABLING AND DISABLING LATEX TO UNICODE      *julia-vim-L2U-enable-disable*

The LaTeX-to-Unicode functionality can be enabled or disabled at any time,
regardless of the |'filetype'| of the file you're editing, using the functions
|LaTeXtoUnicode#Enable()|, |LaTeXtoUnicode#Disable()|, |LaTeXtoUnicode#Toggle()|.
For example, you could use a mapping like:
>
    noremap <expr> <F7> LaTeXtoUnicode#Toggle()
    inoremap <expr> <F7> LaTeXtoUnicode#Toggle()
<
and then use the <F7> key to quickly switch the functionality on and off as
needed (the first mapping is for |Normal| mode, the second for |Insert| mode).

NOTE: these functions are different from the variables |g:latex_to_unicode_tab|
and |g:latex_to_unicode_auto|: the functions enable/disable the functionality
as a whole, while the variables control individual features (tab substitution
and auto substitution).

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                         *julia-vim-L2U-variables*

                                                   *g:latex_to_unicode_tab*
g:latex_to_unicode_tab

                Determines whether to map LaTeX-to-Unicode substitution to the
                <Tab> key while in insert mode (and to the <S-Tab> combination
                for command line mode), see |julia-vim-L2U-tab|. If unspecified,
                it is on.  You can disable the feature by default by inserting
                the line
>
                    let g:latex_to_unicode_tab = 0
<
                in your |.vimrc| file. You can change this setting at any moment
                while editing, but you need to invoke |LaTeXtoUnicode#Init()|
                for the change to take effect.
                
                                           *g:latex_to_unicode_suggestions*
g:latex_to_unicode_suggestions

                Determines whether the <Tab> key mapping produces suggestions
                for partial matches. By default, this is set to 1 (active),
                unless a plug-in which is known to be incompatible with it is
                detected. Currently, known incompatible plug-ins are
                YouCompleteMe (https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) and
                neocomplcache (https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim).

                This variable can be set at any time, changes will immediately
                take effect.
                
                                                 *g:latex_to_unicode_eager*
g:latex_to_unicode_eager

                Determines whether the <Tab> key mapping performs the
                substitution immediately upon finding an exact match. By
                default this setting is set to 1 (active), so that e.g. typing
                `\ne` and pressing the <Tab> key triggers the substitution. If
                this variable is set to 0, an exact match which is also a
                possible partial match to some other sequence triggers the
                suggestions menu first, but another <Tab> forces the
                substitution, so that e.g. typing `\ne` and then <Tab>
                produces a list with `\ne`, `\neg`, `\nequiv` etc., and
                pressing <Tab> again performs the substitution.

                This variable can be set at any time, changes will immediately
                take effect. When |g:latex_to_unicode_suggestions| is 0,
                this setting has no effect (it's like if it was always on).
                
                                                  *g:latex_to_unicode_auto*
g:latex_to_unicode_auto

                Determines whether to activate LaTeX-to-Unicode substitution
                on the fly as you type (in |Insert| mode), see
                |julia-vim-L2U-as-you-type|. If unspecified, it is 0 (off).
                You can enable the feature by default by inserting the line
>
                    let g:latex_to_unicode_auto = 1
<
                in your |.vimrc| file. You can change this setting at any
                moment while editing, but you need to invoke
                |LaTeXtoUnicode#Init()| for the change to take effect.

                                            *g:latex_to_unicode_file_types*
g:latex_to_unicode_file_types

                Contains a |pattern|, or a list of patterns, which are matched
                against the |'filetype'| to determine when to enable the
                LaTeX-to-Unicode functionality, see |julia-vim-L2U-file-types|.
                By default, its value is `"julia"`. The patterns provided must
                match the whole filetype name. See also
                |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist|.

                                  *g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist*
g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist

                Same as |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types|, but acts in reverse:
                it disables the LaTeX-to-Unicode functionality when the
                |'filetype'| matches the provided pattern (or any of the
                patterns if a list is provided). By default, it contains an
                unmatchable pattern, i.e. it is effectively disabled.

==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS                                         *julia-vim-L2U-functions*

                                                    *LaTeXtoUnicode#Init()*
LaTeXtoUnicode#Init()

                Initialize or re-initialize the LaTeX-to-Unicode substitutions
                (see |julia-vim-L2U-introduction|). Must be invoked after
                changing |g:latex_to_unicode_tab| or |g:latex_to_unicode_auto|
                to make the changes take effect.

                                                  *LaTeXtoUnicode#Enable()*
                                                 *LaTeXtoUnicode#Disable()*
                                                  *LaTeXtoUnicode#Toggle()*
LaTeXtoUnicode#Enable()
LaTeXtoUnicode#Disable()
LaTeXtoUnicode#Toggle()

                These functions enable/disable/toggle the LaTeX-to-Unicode
                functionality, regardless of the |'filetype'| specified in
                |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types| and
                |g:latex_to_unicode_file_types_blacklist|. See
                |julia-vim-L2U-enable-disable|. Note that LaTeXtoUnicode#Enable()
                will override the |'omnifunc'| definition, if present. However,
                LaTeXtoUnicode#Disable() will restore it.
                These functions implicitly invoke |LaTeXtoUnicode#Init()|.
